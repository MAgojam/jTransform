        <h2>More detailed explanation</h2>
        <p>“Variables that identify the same unit” is an ID variable (e.g., a
        participant code). This code needs to be unique (i.e., there can't be
        two participants, or other units, with the same ID).</p>
        <p>“Variables to be transformed” are the so-called target variables, i.e.,
        variables that exist as many columns in the input data set and are
        going to be transformed, creating different steps of one or more
        time-varying variable resulting in the output. How many variables are
        created is determined by how many parts the variable name has (the
        parts are split by the character defined as “Separator”) and how many
        steps / different values exist within each part. If we had a variable
        with 4 parts, each with two steps per step, this would result in four
        columns (starting with the string defined as “Prefix” and ending with
        1, 2, 3, and 4). The number of rows would be increased by the number
        of all possible combinations of steps (in the example above 2 * 2 * 2
        * 2 = 16, mulitiplied by the number of rows in the input data set,
        e.g., 50 rows becoming 50 * 16 = 800 rows).</p>
        <p>“Variables NOT to be transformed” are variables that “characterize” a
        participant (or another unit), often also called between-subjects
        variables, e.g., age or sex. However, they are not unique (and thus
        no ID variables; there may be several participant with the same age or
        sex).</p>
        <p>“Separator” defines which character(s) should be placed between the
        target variable and the steps of the time-varying variable /
        conditions when assembling the variable names (e.g., VAR_COND).</p>
        <p>Often, an input data set contains different types of measures (e.g.,
        whether a response was correct and the reaction time) that make up a
        part of the variable name. Typically, one wants to keep those
        different measures as separate columns in the output data set.
        "Exclude level" permits to exclude one (or more) part (in the steps
        in it) from being transformed from wide to long. If the measurement
        types were the first part of the variable name, 1 would have to be
        put into this field. If all levels are to be transformed, the field
        needs to be blank.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The principle of the transformation from long to wide can perhaps
        easiest be understood by looking at example4jtWide2Long from the Data
        Library of this module. It contains results from a Stroop experiment
        (in wide format) with fifty variables: ID (identifies the participant),
        sex (of the participant), and afterwards 48 variables that represent a
        combination of the measurement (first part of the variable name, rspCrr
        – whether the response was correct – or rspTme – reaction time), the
        experimental condition / congruency (second part; either cong[ruent],
        incong[ruent] or neutral), the colour the word was written with (third
        part; BLUE, GREEN, RED or YELLOW) and which repetition of a particular
        combination of experimental conditions the variable represents (fourth
        part, 1 or 2). These variables have to be assigned to the following
        fields: ID to “Variables that identify the same unit” (it is an unique
        identifier of each participant); sex to “Variables NOT to be
        transformed” (sex is a between-subjects variable that doesn't change
        between experimental conditions; however, it is not unique and thus not
        suited as ID variable); and the remaining variables (i.e., all
        variables starting with rspCrr_... or rspTme... to “Variables to be
        transformed”. Under “Prefix” it can be determined how the name for the
        different conditions shall start (a number would be added if there is
        more than one condition).</p>
