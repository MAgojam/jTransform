      Please assign at least one variable to at least one of the variable boxes
      indicating what (approximate) degree (moderate, strong, extreme and kind
      (postive or negative) of skewness this variable has. For moderately
      skewed variables, a square-root-transformation is used, for strongly
      skewed variables, a logarithic transformation, and for severly skewed
      variables an inversion. If necessary, a constant is added (automatically)
      in order to avoid the transformation returning NA-values.</p>
      <p>NB: The transformations work only for numeric variables (integer or
      decimal); please adjust the measure / data type if necessary.
