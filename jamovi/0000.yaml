  jTransform carries out common data management tasks and transformations of
  data sets. It includes functions to search and replace values, to sort a data
  set after one or more variable, to change the order of variables in a data
  set, to transform data sets from long to wide or from wide to long, to
  transpose data sets (make rows into columns and columns into rows), and to add
  columns from one or more additional data sets to the currently opened data
  set.
