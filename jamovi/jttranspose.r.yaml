        <h2>More detailed explanation</h2>
        <p>Please assign maximally one variable to the variable box “Variable
        with column names for the output” (this variable might contain names of
        trials or questionnaire items). If you leave the box empty, generic
        variable names are generated (“V_...”).</p>
        <p>The variables to be transposed (i.e., those to become rows in your
        output data set) have to be assigned to “Variables to be
        transposed”.</p>
