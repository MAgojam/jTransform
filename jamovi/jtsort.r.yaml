        <p><strong>This function sorts a dataset after one or more variables.
        </strong></p>
        <p>Please assign one or more variables to the variable box “Variable(s)
        to be sorted after”. The order in which the variables appear in the
        variable box determines after which variable is sorted first (one
        could, e.g., first sort after gender and afterwards after age).</p>
        <p>Variables are sorted in ascending order (as default), but you can
        change the order if desired.</p>
        <p>Currently, the remaining variables (i.e., those not to be used for
        sorting but to be included into the output file) have to be assigned to
        “Further variables in the output”.</p>
        <p>Under “Output file”, you can adjust the name of the output file. You
        may also add a directory to the file name. If no path is given, the
        output file is stored in the home directory.</p>
