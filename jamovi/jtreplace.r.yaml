      Please type the original value and the replacement into the entry fields.
      If you want to have several pairs of original and replacment values, use
      separate lines. To replace partial matches, unset the tick box "Whole
      Word" (e.g., for orginal: 24 and replacement: 34, 241 will be changed
      into 341).</p>
      <p>The <strong>"Include / Exclude"</strong> collapse box permits to
      specifically select in which column types, for which measurement type,
      and in which variables <strong>to replace values</strong>. Ticking the
      check boxes includes that variable or measurement type. When selecting
      individual variables using the variable input, set the radio button to
      either only include the selected variables or to exclude them (i.e.,
      to exclude values only in the remaining variables).
