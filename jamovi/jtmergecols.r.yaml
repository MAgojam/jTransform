      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>There are four different types of merging operations: The first
      option keeps all cases (but columns in the resulting data set may be
      empty if they did not contain values in same input data sets), the
      second option keeps only those cases where all datasets contain the same
      value in the matching variable, for “left” all cases from the first data
      set are kept (whereas cases that are only contained in input data set
      two or higher are dropped), for “right” all cases from the second (or
      any higher) data set are kept.</p>
