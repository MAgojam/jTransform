      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>There are four different types of merging operations: The option
      "Keeps All Cases (Rows)" keeps all cases (but if some input data sets did
      not contain that value of the matching variable, there might be missing
      values for variable from that data set). The second option "Keeps Only
      Cases Contained in All Merged Data Sets" keeps only those cases where a
      particular value of the matching variable was contained in all datasets.
      The option "Keeps All Cases From the Currently Opened Data Set" keeps
      all rows / cases from the active data set (whereas cases that are only
      contained in the data sets defined under "Data Set(s) to Add" are
      dropped). The option "Keeps All Cases From the Data Sets To Be Added"
      keeps all cases from the data sets defined under "Data Set(s) to Add"
      (whereas cases that are only contained in the active data set are
      dropped).</p>
      <p>If there are variables with the same name in several of the input data
      sets, it will checked whether they contain the same content. If they are
      the same, only the first of these identical variables is kept (and the
      others are removed). If they are different, the name of the first of
      these variables is kept, and a suffix with their position (_2, _3, etc.)
      will be added to the name of all other variables.</p>
