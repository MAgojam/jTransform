        <p><strong>Adds columns from other jamovi data file(s) to the current
        data set (matching them by one or more ID variables).</strong></p>
        <p>Assign one or more variables that appear in all data sets (e.g.,
        with a participant code) to “Variable(s) to match the data sets by”.
        Afterwards, you need to assign the remaining variables (i.e., those
        that you do not want to exclude from the output data file) to “Further
        variables in the output”.</p>
        <p>The file browser under “Data set(s) to add” represents a “tweaked”
        solution: Because it only delivers the file name back, the home
        directory is afterwards searched for those file name(s). If a file
        can't be located in the home directory, or if it exists in more than
        one locations inside the home directory, an error is returned. Although
        it is less convenient, manually providing the file name including the
        path may therefore be both quicker and less error-prone. If several
        file names are provided, they have to be separated by semicolons.</p>
        <p>There are four different types of merging operations: The first option
        keeps all cases (but columns in the resulting data set may be empty if
        they did not contain values in same input data sets), the second option
        keeps only those cases where all datasets contain the same value in the
        matching variable, for "left" all cases from the first data set in
        fleInp are kept (whereas cases that are only contained in input data
        set two or higher are dropped), for "right" all cases from the second
        (or any higher) data set in fleInp are kept.</p>
        <p>Under “Output file”, you can adjust the name of the output file. You
        may also add a directory to the file name. If no path is given, the
        output file is stored in the home directory.</p>
