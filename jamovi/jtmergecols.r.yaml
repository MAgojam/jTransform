        There are four different types of merging operations: The first option
        keeps all cases (but columns in the resulting data set may be empty if
        they did not contain values in same input data sets), the second option
        keeps only those cases where all datasets contain the same value in the
        matching variable, for "left" all cases from the first data set in
        fleInp are kept (whereas cases that are only contained in input data
        set two or higher are dropped), for "right" all cases from the second
        (or any higher) data set in fleInp are kept.<br>
