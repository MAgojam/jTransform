      Please assign the variables from the data set that should be included
      in the calculation of distances to "Variables To Calculate Distances For"
      and then select whether the distances are to be calculated between
      "Columns" or "Rows". You need at least two variables and two rows to
      calculate distances. Select then whether the input data are to be
      standardized (before calculating the distances) and which distance
      measure should be calculated.
