Description:
    The jamovi module jTransform carries out common data management tasks and
    transformations of data sets. It includes functions to change the order of
    / re-arrange variables in a data set, transforming a data set from long to
    wide or from wide to long, transposing a data set (make rows into columns
    and columns into rows), sorting a data set after one or more variable, and
    adding columns from one or more additional data sets to the currently
    opened data set.
    jTransform calls functions from the R-package `jmvReadWrite`,
    (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=jmvReadWrite>) enabling access to
    these functions via a graphical user interface (without the need to use
    a R command line for these transformations).
