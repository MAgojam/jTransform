Description:
    jTransform carries out common data management tasks and transformations of
    data sets. It includes functions to change the order of / re-arrange
    variables in a data set, transforming a data set from long to wide or from
    wide to long, transposing a data set (make rows into columns and columns
    into rows), sorting a data set after one or more variable, and adding
    columns from one or more additional data sets to the currently opened data
    set.
    jTransform calls functions from the R-package `jmvReadWrite`,
    (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=jmvReadWrite>) enabling access to
    these functions via a graphical user interface (without the need to use
    a R command line for these transformations).
